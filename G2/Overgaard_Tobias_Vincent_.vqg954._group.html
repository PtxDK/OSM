<h1 id="uh-oh">Uh-oh!</h1>
<p>Please adhere <em>strictly</em> to the assignment text: Submit a <code>.tar.gz</code> and not a <code>.zip</code>. (We’re GNU/Linux folks here, not Windows end users.)</p>
<h1 id="task-1-userland-processes">Task 1: Userland processes</h1>
<p>Your <code>process_exit</code> doesn’t call <code>sleepq_wake</code> – which is necessary to wake up the waiting <code>process_join</code>.</p>
<p>I don’t see a need for the <code>DEAD</code> state.</p>
<p>The <em>main</em> problem in your <code>process_spawn</code> is that the <code>entry_point</code> and <code>stack_top</code> used by the new process must be available forever, but you use the automatically ones from inside <code>process_spawn</code>, which will get automatically deallocated once the function returns. You need to store these two attributes somewhere static, e.g. in the process table. They are used for storing the low-level state of a process when the scheduler switches threads.</p>
<p>In pseudocode, this is what I would to do for the different types and functions. Apologies if I write about something which you’ve already done correctly (in which case I probably just missed that).</p>
<h2 id="the-states">The states</h2>
<pre><code>typedef enum {
    PROCESS_FREE,
    PROCESS_RUNNING,
    PROCESS_ZOMBIE
} process_state_t;</code></pre>
<p>You only really need three states: <code>PROCESS_FREE</code> to describe that the slot is available, <code>PROCESS_RUNNING</code> to describe that it’s currently in use, and <code>PROCESS_ZOMBIE</code> to describe that it’s dead, but that the parent might still join it to get its return value, which the child process has itself set beforing going into the zombie state.</p>
<p>If our process abstraction was more powerful, e.g. with an advanced filesystem, we might like to have more states. But for our basic process support, these three are enough.</p>
<h2 id="the-struct">The struct</h2>
<pre><code>typedef struct {
/* We need to keep track of a process&#39; state to make sure calls to eg. `join` do
 * the right thing. */
  process_state_t state;

/* A parent should be able to get a child&#39;s return value after it exits, so we
 * store it here. */
  int retval;

/* Initial contents of some registers.  We need to store these somewhere in
 * always-available memory, so we might as well do it here. */
  virtaddr_t entry_point;
  virtaddr_t stack_top;

} process_control_block_t;</code></pre>
<p>If you want to add a bit of error detection, you can also store the PID of the parent, since only a process’ parent should be able to interface with itself.</p>
<h2 id="process_spawn"><code>process_spawn</code></h2>
<pre><code>/* Load and run the executable as a new process in a new thread
 * Argument: executable file name; Returns: process ID of the new process */
process_id_t process_spawn(char const* executable, char const **argv)
{
  interrupt_status_t intr_status;
  TID_t thread;
  process_id_t pid;
  int ret;

  /* Disable interrupts, and lock the entire process table.  You need to have
   * defined a spinlock for this for this to work.
   */
  intr_status = _interrupt_disable();
  spinlock_acquire(&amp;some_spinlock);

  pid = find an empty spot;

  /* Spawn a new thread, and make it start in `process_run`.  Don&#39;t actually run
   * the thread yet.  Type casting of functions in C is horrible.
   */
  thread = thread_create((void (*)(uint32_t))(&amp;process_run), pid);

  /* Before we start running the new thread, we have to load the executable into
   * memory.  Technically, we could also do this in the new thread, but we would
   * have to copy over memory to the new thread (e.g. `executable` and `argv`),
   * since right now they reside only in the memory of the old thread.
   */
  ret = setup_new_process(...);

  /* We are now done modifying the process table, so unlock it. */
  spinlock_release(&amp;some_spinlock);
  _interrupt_set_state(intr_status);

  /* Run the thread. */
  thread_run(thread);

  return ret;
}

void process_run(process_id_t pid)
{
  /* This function needs to do the same thing as the bottom of `process_start`,
   * but instead of working on the old thread, it should work on the new
   * thread.  Also, while `process_start` stores `user_context` and `stack_top`
   * on the call stack, in our approach they are stored in the process struct.
   */

  set pagetable;
  initialize user context;
  goto userland;
}</code></pre>
<p>In short, <code>process_spawn</code> should make the new thread, load the executable into its memory, and start the new thread. You should not have to modify <code>setup_new_process</code>. Again, you’re very welcome to do some more error checks.</p>
<h2 id="process_exit"><code>process_exit</code></h2>
<pre><code>/* Stop the current process and the kernel thread in which it runs
 * Argument: return value */

  lock the process table;

  set the current process state to ZOMBIE;
  save the retval in the current process table entry;

  /* Destroy the pagetable.  We don&#39;t need the memory anymore. */
  vm_destroy_pagetable(thread-&gt;pagetable);
  thread-&gt;pagetable = NULL;

  /* Send a message to a waiting `process_join` that the data in the process
   * block has changed.  Here, we use the pointer to the process block as the
   * sleep queue resource.  The only requirement for the resource is that we can
   * also use it in `process_join` when calling `sleepq_add`.
   */
  sleepq_wake_all(&amp;process_table[cur]);

  unlock the process table;

  /* Destroy the current thread. */
  thread_finish();
}</code></pre>
<p>The main purpose of <code>process_exit</code> is to save its return value <code>retval</code> and then signal any waiting <code>process_join</code> call that something has changed.</p>
<h2 id="process_join"><code>process_join</code></h2>
<pre><code>/* Wait for the given process to terminate, return its return value,
 * and mark the process-table entry as free. */
int process_join(process_id_t pid) {
  check if the pid seems valid;

  lock the process table;

  while (the state of the pid process is not PROCESS_ZOMBIE) {
      /* Use the code structure from
       * &lt;https://kudos.readthedocs.org/en/latest/advanced-synchronization.html#sleeping-on-a-resource&gt;.
       * Use the same resource as in `process_exit`, so that `process_join`
       * knows what it should wait for.
       */
    }

  get the retval of the process at pid;

  /* The child is done.  It can only have one parent, so we don&#39;t need its
   * slot anymore.
   */
  set the state of the current process to PROCESS_FREE;

  unlock the process table;

  return the gotten retval;
}</code></pre>
<p><code>process_join</code> should wait for <code>process_exit</code> and nothing else. If <code>process_exit</code> has already been called, then it shouldn’t wait, but that is also handled by the while loop.</p>
<h2 id="process_init"><code>process_init</code></h2>
<pre><code>/* Initialize process table.
 * Should be called before any other process-related calls */
void process_init(void) {
  loop through the process table and set the state of all slots;
}</code></pre>
<p>You need to make KUDOS call this on startup. KUDOS startup happens in <code>init/common.c</code>, so put it somewhere in that file.</p>
<h2 id="process_get_current_process"><code>process_get_current_process</code></h2>
<pre><code>/* Return PID of current process. */
process_id_t process_get_current_process(void) {
  fetch the pid from wherever you stored in in the thread struct;
}</code></pre>
<h2 id="process_get_current_process_entry"><code>process_get_current_process_entry</code></h2>
<pre><code>/* Return PCB of current process. */
process_control_block_t *process_get_current_process_entry(void) {
  use process_get_current_process;
}</code></pre>
<h1 id="task-2-syscalls-for-userland-processes">Task 2: Syscalls for userland processes</h1>
<p>The syscalls look fine.</p>
<p>I would like a test program that spawns e.g. “[disk]hw.mips32”, then joins it to wait for it to finish, and then prints the return value.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Please resubmit. Fix task 1, and show that it’s working.</p>
